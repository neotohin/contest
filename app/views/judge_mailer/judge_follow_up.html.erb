  <p>
    Great news! The EDDY Awards are live for Reader’s Choice voting at
    <a href="http://www.ediblefeast.com/eddyawards">www.ediblefeast.com/eddyawards</a>.
    We're thrilled with the set of finalists that were so thoughtfully curated
    by you and the rest of our
    <a href="http://www.ediblefeast.com/eddyawards/vote/2016/judges">phenomenal panel of judges</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through Sunday, March 15 at 11:59pm ET, please <strong>go to the
    <a href="http://www.ediblefeast.com/eddyawards">site</a> as often as you can
    to vote for your favorites</strong> and see how they’re doing! (You can vote
    once daily in each category.) We’re using #EDDYS2016 to promote the EDDYs in
    social media, so we hope you'll spread the word about the Awards and
    encourage your followers to vote too.

    The categories you reviewed entries in are noted below so you can see the
    finalists that made it through. All finalists are eligible to be the
    Reader’s Choice winner as well as the Critic’s Choice winner in their
    respective categories. All winners (including the Critic’s Choice recipient for
    Best Special Issue) will be announced on Thursday, March 19, 2016 at the
    <a href="http://www.ediblefeast.com/my-edible-grid-view">Edible Communities</a>'
